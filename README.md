This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the catch-all route '*' in React Router v6.  The problem arises when the catch-all route is defined after other routes.  This leads to the catch-all route being ignored, and the application seemingly redirects to the home page, even for invalid paths. The solution shows how to correctly place the catch-all route to effectively handle all unmatched paths.
